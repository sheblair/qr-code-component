## Overview

This was my first challenge with Frontend Mentor. I used a mobile-first approach to build a QR code card for mobile, tablet, and desktop sites.

## My process

I started by building my HTML and then moved on to CSS, using a mobile-first workflow. I used Chrome DevTools liberally to make finetune adjustments as I was finishing up the project. Although the challenge only called for mobile and desktop sites, I found that I preferred to add third breakpoint for tablet screen sizes (675px).

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

1. One initial error was using percentages instead of pixels in my border-radius property. For awhile I couldn't figure out why my rounded corners were looking so weird, and then I eventually figured out that I needed to switch to pixels.

2. Another thing that I was wondering as I built this was whether or not to add a margin above the main container div so that it would sit a little lower on the page in desktop view, rather than flush at the top of the screen. I ended up deciding to add some space, because I thought it looked a little odd without. I'm not sure if there is a right answer here.

### Continued development

My goal with working on this challenge was to get more practice using CSS flexbox to build responsive websites and components in a mobile-first workflow. I got some good practice and I'm ready to take on some more challenging builds!
